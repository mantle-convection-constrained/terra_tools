Terra output files are currently written out serially, that is one file per process. Some
users may find it convenient to concatenate files from a dump into a single file using
`ncecat`, a tool which is available through the NetCDF operators package. Terratools also
supports reading concatenated files `model = read_netcdf(file,cat=True)`.

##Plot a 1D average profile
We can return a 1D profile of the radial average of a field using:

# %%

temp_mean = model.mean_radial_profile(field="t")

And we can get the radii using:
"""

radii = model.get_radii()

And now we can plot the 1D profile.
